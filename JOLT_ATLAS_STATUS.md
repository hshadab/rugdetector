## 📊 Jolt Atlas Architecture (CORRECTED)

### **NOT a zkSNARK System**

Jolt Atlas uses **lookup-based arguments** (Lasso/Shout), which are fundamentally different from traditional zkSNARKs:

| Feature | zkSNARKs (Groth16/PLONK) | Jolt Atlas (Lookup-Based) |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Core Primitive** | R1CS circuits | Lookup tables |
| **Proof System** | Polynomial commitments + pairings | Lasso lookup argument |
| **For ML** | Inefficient (ReLU = 1000s of gates) | Efficient (ReLU = single lookup) |
| **Trusted Setup** | Required (Groth16) | Not required |
| **Proving Time** | Minutes | < 1 second |
| **Proof Size** | ~200 bytes | ~10 KB |
| **Verifier Time** | ~10ms | ~150ms |

### **How Jolt Atlas Works:**

```
1. Load ONNX Model
   ↓
2. Compile to RISC-V bytecode
   ↓
3. Execute program with Jolt VM
   ↓
4. For each instruction:
   - Look up result in precomputed table
   - Generate Lasso lookup proof
   ↓
5. Aggregate all lookups into single proof
   ↓
6. Return: (output, lookup_proof)
```

### **Key Optimizations for ML:**

- **ReLU**: Precomputed lookup table instead of circuit
- **SoftMax**: Direct table lookups
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Optimized precompiles
- **Quantization**: Native support for fixed-point arithmetic

## 🎯 Integration with RugDetector

### **Current Status:**

```python
# rugdetector/zkml_prover_wrapper.py

from zkml_prover_wrapper import JoltAtlasProver

# Initialize prover
prover = JoltAtlasProver()

# Generate proof for rug pull detection
features = extract_features(contract_address)  # 60 features
output, proof = prover.prove_inference(
    "model/rugdetector_v1.onnx",
    features
)

# Output:
# {
#   "proof_id": "cc0bad36b87b96ea",
#   "protocol": "jolt-atlas-v1",
#   "proof_system": "lookup-based (Lasso/Shout)",

## 🔧 How to Use

### **1. Test the Wrapper:**

```bash
cd /home/hshadab/rugdetector
python3 zkml_prover_wrapper.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Jolt Atlas binary found (or fallback message)
📦 Loading model: model/rugdetector_v1.onnx
🔐 Generating Jolt Atlas proof...
✅ Proof generated successfully!
📊 Model Output: Risk Score: 0.7850
✅ Proof verification successful!
```

### **2. Run Benchmarks (once binary is ready):**

```bash
cd zkml-jolt-atlas/zkml-jolt-core
cargo run --release -- profile --name multi-class --format default
```

### **3. Integrate with RugDetector API:**

```javascript
// In api/routes/check.js
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// Call Python wrapper
const result = execSync(`python3 zkml_prover_wrapper.py analyze ${contractAddress}`);
const { riskScore, proof } = JSON.parse(result);

// Return with zkML proof
res.json({
  success: true,
  data: {
    riskScore,
    zkml: proof,
    verifiable: true
  }
});
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ Wait for zkml-jolt-core binary compilation to finish
2. ⏳ Test the compiled binary with sample ONNX model
3. ⏳ Verify proof generation works end-to-end

### **Short Term (This Week):**
1. Integrate wrapper with zkml_server.py
2. Update API to include zkML proofs in responses
3. Create verification endpoint for agents
4. Test with real contract addresses
5. Measure performance metrics

### **Medium Term (This Month):**
1. Optimize for RugDetector's specific model structure
2. Cache preprocessing for faster subsequent proofs
3. Add on-chain verification support (Solidity verifier)
4. Create agent SDK for easy integration
5. Deploy to production with zkML proofs

## 💡 Why This Matters

### **For AI Agents:**

Before zkML:
```
Agent: "Is this token safe?"
RugDetector: "Yes, risk score = 0.2"
Agent: "I have to trust you blindly"
```

With Jolt Atlas zkML:
```
Agent: "Is this token safe?"
RugDetector: "Yes, risk score = 0.2 + here's a cryptographic proof"
Agent: *verifies proof in 150ms*
Agent: "Proof valid! I know you computed this correctly"
```

### **Trust Model:**

| Without zkML | With Jolt Atlas |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Blind trust | Cryptographic verification |
| Service can lie | Lying is cryptographically impossible |
| No accountability | Provable fraud if wrong |
| Centralized | Decentralized trust |

## 📝 Technical Notes

### **Why "Lookup-Based" is Better for ML:**

Traditional zkSNARKs represent computation as arithmetic circuits:
```
ReLU(x) = max(0, x)
→ Requires 1000+ R1CS constraints
→ Expensive to prove
```

Jolt Atlas uses lookup tables:
```
ReLU(x) = lookup in precomputed table
→ Single Lasso lookup argument
→ 100x faster
```

### **Lasso Lookup Argument:**

1. **Prover Claims**: "Value V is in table T at index I"
2. **Commits** to V, I using polynomial commitments
3. **Proves** using sum-check protocol that commitment is correct
4. **Verifier** checks in ~150ms without recomputing

### **No Trusted Setup:**

Unlike Groth16 zkSNARKs, Jolt Atlas doesn't require a trusted setup ceremony. This makes it:
- More transparent
- Easier to deploy
- No risk of compromised setup
