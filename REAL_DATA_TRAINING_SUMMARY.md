# RugDetector v2.0: Real Data Training Implementation

## Executive Summary

I've implemented a complete pipeline to train the RugDetector model on **real rug pull and legitimate token data** instead of synthetic data. This addresses the critical weakness identified in the assessment: the original model (v1.0) was trained on 5,000 synthetic samples with unknown real-world accuracy.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Data Collection System (`training/collect_real_data.py`)

**Collects real labeled data from multiple sources:**

#### Rug Pull Sources
- **Manual Curated List**: 14 documented rug pulls from high-profile incidents (2021-2024)
  - Squid Game (SQUID): $3.38M loss
  - AnubisDAO: $60M loss
  - StableMagnet (BSC): $22M loss
  - Meerkat Finance (BSC): $31M loss
  - Plus 10 more across Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Base

- **CRPWarner Dataset**: Academic research dataset with 645 real rug pulls
  - Location: `~/CRPWarner_RugPull/dataset/groundtruth/`
  - Source: https://github.com/CRPWarner/RugPull
  - Automatically detected if cloned locally

- **Token Sniffer API**: Real-time malicious token detection (optional)
  - Requires Enterprise API key
  - Fetches tokens from last 24 hours
  - Up to 100 recent scam tokens

#### Legitimate Token Sources
- **Manual Verified List**: 30+ established DeFi protocols
  - Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Chainlink (LINK)
  - Stablecoins: USDC, USDT, DAI
  - Wrapped assets: WETH, WBTC
  - Across Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Base

- **CoinGecko API**: Top 100 tokens by market cap
  - Fetches current market leaders
  - Filters for ERC-20 tokens with contract addresses
  - Ensures high-quality legitimate examples

**Output:**
- `rugpull_addresses.csv` - All rug pull addresses
- `legitimate_addresses.csv` - All legitimate addresses
- `labeled_dataset.csv` - Combined dataset with labels
- `data_collection_report.txt` - Summary statistics

---

### 2. Batch Feature Extraction (`training/extract_features_batch.py`)

**Extracts 60 blockchain features from each contract:**

- Runs existing `model/extract_features.py` in batch mode
- Processes contracts sequentially with progress tracking
- Handles timeouts (60s default per contract)
- Catches and logs errors gracefully
- Shows progress every 10 contracts
- Estimates time remaining

**Features Extracted** (60 total):
- **Ownership** (10): ownerBalance, hasRenounceOwnership, ownerBlacklisted, etc.
- **Liquidity** (12): hasLiquidityLock, liquidityRatio, liquidityLockedDays, etc.
- **Holder Analysis** (10): holderConcentration, top10HoldersPercent, whaleCount, etc.
- **Contract Code** (15): hasHiddenMint, hasProxyPattern, hasSelfDestruct, etc.
- **Transactions** (8): avgDailyTransactions, transactionVelocity, highFailureRate, etc.
- **Time-Based** (5): contractAge, lastActivityDays, deployedDuringBullMarket, etc.

**Output:**
- `features_extracted.csv` - All contracts with 60 features + metadata
- Progress tracking with success/failure counts

---

### 3. Enhanced Training Pipeline (`training/train_model_real.py`)

**Trains RandomForest on real data with comprehensive evaluation:**

#### Model Configuration
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,         # 200 trees (up from 100)
    max_depth=25,             # Deeper trees (up from 20)
    min_samples_split=5,
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    max_features='sqrt',      # Feature sampling for diversity
    class_weight='balanced',  # Handle class imbalance
    random_state=42
)
```

#### Training Process
1. **Data Loading**
   - Load CSV with 60 features
   - Convert labels to numeric (low=0, medium=1, high=2)
   - Fill NaN values with 0

2. **Data Splitting**
   - 70% training set
   - 15% validation set (hyperparameter tuning)
   - 15% test set (final evaluation, never seen during training)
   - Stratified split preserves class distribution

3. **Model Training**
   - Fit RandomForest on training set
   - Evaluate on validation set
   - Final evaluation on test set

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion matrix
   - 5-fold cross-validation with stratification
   - Per-class metrics (Low/Medium/High risk)

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Ranks all 60 features by importance
   - Saves to `feature_importance.csv`
   - Includes top 10 in metadata

6. **ONNX Export**
   - Converts to ONNX format (onnxruntime-node compatible)
   - Strips ZipMap for tensor outputs
   - Saves with comprehensive metadata

**Output:**
- `model/rugdetector_v2_real.onnx` - Trained model (ONNX format)
- `model/rugdetector_v2_real_metadata.json` - Model metadata + metrics
- `model/feature_importance.csv` - Feature importance rankings
- `model/training_report_v2.txt` - Comprehensive training report

---

### 4. Automated Pipeline (`training/train_pipeline.sh`)

**One-command execution of entire workflow:**

```bash
cd training
./train_pipeline.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Collects real data (or uses existing)
2. Extracts features from all contracts
3. Trains model on extracted features
4. Generates all reports and artifacts
5. Provides deployment instructions

**Features:**
- Checks for existing data (asks before re-collecting)
- Shows progress and time estimates
- Validates minimum data requirements (warns if <20 contracts)
- Error handling with clear messages
- Success rate tracking

---

## How to Use

### Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
cd /home/hshadab/rugdetector/training

# 1. Collect real data
python3 collect_real_data.py

# 2. Extract features
python3 extract_features_batch.py real_data/labeled_dataset.csv

# 3. Train model
python3 train_model_real.py real_data/features_extracted.csv
```

### Or Use Automated Pipeline

```bash
cd /home/hshadab/rugdetector/training
./train_pipeline.sh
```

## Expected Results

### Dataset Size (Without External Datasets)

| Source | Count | Label |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Manual Rug Pulls | 14 | high_risk |
| Manual Legitimate | 30+ | low_risk |
| CoinGecko Top 100 | ~50 | low_risk |
| **Total** | **~94+** | - |

**With CRPWarner dataset** (if cloned):
- +645 rug pulls → **~739 total contracts**

**With Token Sniffer API** (if Enterprise key):
- +50-100 recent scams → **~789-839 total contracts**

### Performance Expectations

| Metric | Synthetic (v1.0) | Expected Real (v2.0) | Realistic Range |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy | 94% | **70-85%** | Depends on data quality |
| Precision | 92% | **65-80%** | Fewer false positives |
| Recall | 91% | **70-85%** | Detect most rug pulls |
| F1-Score | 91.5% | **67-82%** | Balanced metric |

**Why lower is expected:**
- Real data is noisy (missing features, API failures)
- Rug pull patterns are diverse and evolving
- Class imbalance (more legitimate than rug pulls)
- Feature extraction may timeout or fail

**What matters most:**
- **High recall for high-risk** (catch most rug pulls, even with some false positives)
- **High precision for low-risk** (don't falsely flag legitimate tokens)
- **Consistent CV scores** (model generalizes well)

2. **Add to labeled_dataset.csv**
3. **Re-extract features** for new contracts
4. **Retrain model** with augmented data
5. **Evaluate on holdout test set**
6. **Deploy if accuracy improves**

### Feedback Loop

- Log all predictions to database
- Monitor user reports (false positives/negatives)
- Audit predictions quarterly
- Add misclassified contracts to training set
- Retrain with feedback
