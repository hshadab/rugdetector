## Changes Made

Added X402 badge to the feature badges row at the top of the page:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/coinbase/x402" target="_blank"
   class="feature-badge x402-badge"
   title="X402 Protocol Compliant">
    ðŸ’³ X402 Compliant
</a>
```

**Location:** Below the stats grid, among other feature badges
**Visibility:** High - displayed prominently in the hero section

```html
<div class="footer-badges">
    <a href="https://github.com/coinbase/x402" target="_blank"
       class="footer-badge"
       title="X402 Protocol - HTTP-native payments">
        <svg>...</svg>
        <span>X402 Compliant</span>
    </a>
    <span class="footer-badge">
        <svg>...</svg>
        <span>Secured by zkML</span>
    </span>
    <span class="footer-badge">
        <svg>...</svg>
        <span>100% Real Data</span>
    </span>
</div>
```

**Features:**
- Credit card icon for X402 badge
- Shield icon for zkML security
- Activity icon for real data
- All badges styled consistently

### 3. **Custom CSS Styling** (ui/assets/css/styles.css)

#### X402 Hero Badge Styling (lines 706-738)
```css
.x402-badge {
    background: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.15) !important;
    border: 1px solid rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.4) !important;
    color: var(--accent-cyan) !important;
    font-weight: 600;
    /* ... animated shimmer effect */
}
```

**Special features:**
- Cyan color scheme (different from green feature badges)
- Animated shimmer effect on hover
- Scales up slightly on hover (1.05x)
- Enhanced glow shadow effect
- Bold font weight for emphasis

#### Footer Badge Styling (lines 646-681)
```css
.footer-badges {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: var(--spacing-md);
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.footer-badge {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: var(--spacing-xs);
    /* ... cyan theme with icons */
}
```

**Features:**
- Flexbox layout with wrapping for mobile
- SVG icons with consistent sizing
- Smooth hover transitions
- Cyan glow effect on hover

---

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- **X402 Badges:** Cyan theme (`rgba(0, 255, 255, ...)`)
- **Other Feature Badges:** Green theme (`rgba(0, 255, 136, ...)`)
- **Rationale:** Cyan color distinguishes X402 as a payment/protocol feature

### Hover Effects
1. **Hero Badge:**
   - Shimmer animation (sliding gradient)
   - Scale up to 105%
   - Enhanced cyan glow shadow
   - Smooth 0.3s transitions

2. **Footer Badges:**
   - Background opacity increase
   - Translate up by 2px
   - Cyan glow shadow
   - Smooth transitions

---

## Badge Placement Strategy

### Hero Section (Top of Page)
âœ… **High visibility** - Users see it immediately
âœ… **Among other features** - Shows X402 is a key capability
âœ… **Interactive** - Clicking leads to X402 documentation

### Footer (Bottom of Page)
âœ… **Credibility markers** - Professional trust signals
âœ… **Grouped with security features** - X402 + zkML + Real Data
âœ… **Always visible** - Users see it after scrolling through content

---

## Marketing Benefits
