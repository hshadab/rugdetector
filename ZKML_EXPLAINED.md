# Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning Rug Pull Detector

**A Plain English Guide to How It Works**

---

## What This Service Does

RugDetector analyzes cryptocurrency smart contracts to detect "rug pulls" - scams where developers steal investor money. What makes this special is that it uses **zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML)** to provide cryptographic proof that the AI analysis was performed correctly.

Think of it like getting a notarized certificate with your analysis results - you can independently verify that the AI didn't lie about its conclusion.

---

## How It Works (Step by Step)

### 1. AI Agent Discovers the Service
An AI agent (like Claude, ChatGPT, or custom bots) finds the service by checking:
```
https://rugdetector.onrender.com/.well-known/ai-service.json
```

This file tells the agent:
- What the service does (rug pull detection)
- How much it costs (0.1 USDC on Base network)
- How to use it (API endpoints)

### 2. Payment
The agent sends 0.1 USDC to the service's wallet on Base network and gets a transaction hash (like a receipt).

### 3. Contract Analysis
The agent sends a request with:
- Contract address to check (e.g., `0x1234...`)
- Blockchain name (Base, Solana, etc.)
- Payment transaction hash

The service then:
1. **Verifies the payment** is real and hasn't been used before
2. **Extracts features** from the smart contract (18 different measurements)
3. **Runs AI analysis** using the zkML model
4. **Generates a cryptographic proof** that the analysis was done correctly

### 4. Results + Proof
The agent receives:
- **Risk score** (0-100% chance of rug pull)
- **Risk category** (low/medium/high)
- **Detailed features** analyzed
- **zkML proof** - cryptographic evidence the AI ran correctly

## The zkML Model: Technical Details

### What Makes It Special

**Regular AI**: You have to trust the server ran the model correctly
**zkML AI**: You get mathematical proof it was computed correctly

### Model Specifications

- **Type**: Logistic Regression (simple but effective)
- **Accuracy**: 98.20% on validation set
- **Training Data**: 18,296 real Uniswap V2 contracts
  - 16,462 confirmed rug pulls
  - 1,834 safe tokens
- **Input**: 18 features from the contract
- **Output**: Probability of rug pull (0-1)

### The 18 Features Analyzed

The model looks at these aspects of the token:

1. **mint_count_per_week** - How often new tokens are created
2. **burn_count_per_week** - How often tokens are destroyed
3. **mint_ratio** - Proportion of mint events
4. **swap_ratio** - Proportion of trading activity
5. **burn_ratio** - Proportion of burn events
6. **mint_mean_period** - Average time between mints
7. **swap_mean_period** - Average time between trades
8. **burn_mean_period** - Average time between burns
9. **swap_in_per_week** - Weekly incoming swaps
10. **swap_out_per_week** - Weekly outgoing swaps
11. **swap_rate** - Trading frequency
12. **lp_avg** - Average liquidity pool size
13. **lp_std** - Liquidity pool volatility
14. **lp_creator_holding_ratio** - How much liquidity creator holds
15. **number_of_holders** - Total token holders
16. **creator_balance_in_lp** - Creator's liquidity pool balance
17. **token_age_weeks** - How old the token is
18. **token_creator_holding_ratio** - Creator's token ownership

## How the Zero-Knowledge Proof Works

### What is Jolt-Atlas?

Jolt-Atlas is a **lookup-based** proof system (NOT SNARKs). Think of it like this:

**Old Way (SNARKs)**:
- Convert every calculation into complicated math circuits
- Very slow (minutes to hours)
- Expensive to compute

**Jolt-Atlas Way**:
- Use pre-computed lookup tables for operations
- Much faster (~700ms total)
- More efficient for machine learning

### The Four Operations

Our model only uses operations that work perfectly with Jolt-Atlas:

1. **Mul** - Multiply input features by weights
2. **ReduceSum** - Add all the results together
3. **Add** - Add the bias term
4. **Sigmoid** - Convert to probability (0-1)

**Why not more complex operations?**
We discovered that MatMul (matrix multiplication) causes crashes in Jolt-Atlas. So we designed the model to avoid it by using element-wise operations instead.

### Proof Contents

When you get a zkML proof, it contains:

```json
{
  "proof_id": "unique identifier",
  "protocol": "jolt-atlas-v1",
  "proof_system": "lookup-based (Lasso commitment scheme)",
  "input_commitment": "hash of input features",
  "output_commitment": "hash of output prediction",
  "model_hash": "hash of the model weights",
  "verifiable": true,
  "zkml_enabled": true,
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

**What this proves**:
- The exact model was used (model_hash)
- These exact inputs were used (input_commitment)
- This exact output was produced (output_commitment)
- The computation was done correctly (cryptographic proof)

## Limitations & Trade-offs

### Current Limitations

1. **Limited Operations**
   - Can only use Mul, ReduceSum, Add, Sigmoid
   - MatMul operations crash (known Jolt-Atlas bug)
   - This restricts model complexity

2. **Simple Model Architecture**
   - Logistic regression instead of deep neural networks
   - 18 features instead of 60+ from original dataset
   - Less nuanced than complex models

3. **Feature Mapping**
   - Original 60 features mapped to 18
   - Some information loss in translation
   - Proxy features used when exact matches unavailable

4. **No On-Chain Verification Yet**
   - Proofs generated off-chain
   - Solidity verifier not implemented
   - Can't verify directly in smart contracts (planned feature)

5. **Proof Generation Overhead**
   - ~700ms extra time for proof
   - Compared to <100ms for regular inference
   - Trade-off: speed vs. verifiability

### Why These Trade-offs Are Worth It

Despite the limitations, the system achieves:
- **98.2% accuracy** (better than the complex alternatives we tried)
- **Real cryptographic proofs** (not fake hashes)
- **Production-ready performance** (fast enough for real use)

**Key Insight**: Simple models with good data often outperform complex models with bad data. Logistic regression on 18,000 real rug pulls beats fancy neural networks on synthetic data.

## How to Use (For Developers)

### X402 Protocol Integration

```javascript
// 1. Discover the service
const serviceInfo = await fetch(
  'https://rugdetector.onrender.com/.well-known/ai-service.json'
).then(r => r.json());

const txHash = await sendUSDC(
  serviceInfo.pricing.recipient,
  0.1,
  'base'
);

// 3. Request analysis
const analysis = await fetch(
  'https://rugdetector.onrender.com/check',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is this really zero-knowledge?
**A**: Yes, but in a different sense than privacy. The proof is "zero-knowledge" in that it proves correct computation without revealing how the model works internally. However, inputs and outputs are public.

### Q: Why not use a more complex neural network?
**A**: Jolt-Atlas currently has limitations with MatMul operations. We optimized for what works today while maintaining high accuracy (98.2%).

### Q: Can I verify the proofs on-chain?
**A**: Not yet. On-chain Solidity verifier is planned for Q1 2026.

### Q: How do you prevent the model from being biased?
**A**: The model is trained on real historical data (18,296 contracts). The cryptographic proof ensures we can't change the model weights after training.

### Q: What if the blockchain data is wrong?
**A**: We fetch from public RPC nodes. The proof validates correct computation given the inputs, but can't verify the blockchain data itself is accurate.

### Q: Why charge 0.1 USDC?
**A**: Covers infrastructure costs (RPC calls, compute, storage) plus a small margin. zkML proof generation is computationally intensive.

### Q: Can I run this myself?
**A**: Yes! The code is open source on GitHub. You'll need to train the model and set up the Jolt-Atlas prover.

### Q: What makes this better than existing rug pull detectors?
**A**:
1. Cryptographic proof of correct AI execution
2. 98.2% accuracy on real data
3. X402 protocol for AI agent integration
4. Transparent, verifiable methodology
